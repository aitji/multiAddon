Welcome to the MultiAddon repository! This repo is dedicated to logging files, maintaining file history, and providing changelogs for the MultiAddon, a versatile addon for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. 🏰

<div align="center"><h2> 🌟 Features 🌟</h2></div>

NOTE: THIS ISN'T UP TO DATE

All features can be enabled or disabled as needed. Here's a rundown of what the addon offers:

- **🔄 Inventory Sharing**: Sync player inventories in real-time. 🎒
- **❤️ Health Sharing**: Sync player health across the server. 🩹
- **🌾 Fast Harvest**: Use a hoe to quickly harvest crops and automatically replant seeds. 🚜
- **📦 Sorting**: A comprehensive chest sorting system. 📚
- **🔧 Durability Display**: Show item durability. This feature displays the durability on the item's nametag, item lore, and, if held long enough, on the actionbar. ⛏️
- **🛌 Smooth Sleep**: Allow one player to sleep and smoothly fast-forward the server to daytime. 🌞
- **💡 Dynamic Light**: Holding a light block creates dynamic lighting. This works with items(entity) in the server and item frames(block entity), ensuring that server light blocks remain intact. 🌟
